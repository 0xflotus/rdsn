# rDSN
Robust Distributed System Nucleus (rDSN) is an open framework for quickly building and managing high performance and robust distributed systems. The idea of this framework arises during the team's past efforts to **(semi-) automatically test, debug, optimize, monitor, scale, replicate, compose, and reason about distributed systems**. A lot of challenges were encountered in those projects, and most are due to the fact that the initial development process had not consider these goals, resulting later maintenance difficulties.

rDSN provides a coherent framework from which developers build their systems with **minor adjustment from traditional development styles**. Code built on atop of rDSN conforms to **certain principles**, and can be **upgraded later with little or no cost for achieving the aforementioned goals**.
