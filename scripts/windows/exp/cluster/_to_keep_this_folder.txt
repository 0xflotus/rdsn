This folder should contains cluster files.

For example, we add a file srgsi.txt to the folder, the content is:

srgsi-11
srgsi-12
srgsi-13
srgsi-14
srgsi-15

Then this cluster 'srgsi' is registered.

When running layer1 test:
server: srgsi-11
client: srgsi-12

When running layer2 stateless test:
meta: srgsi-11
daemon: srgsi-12, srgsi-13, srgsi-14
client: srgsi-15

When running layer2 stateful test:
meta: srgsi-11
replica: srgsi-12, srgsi-13, srgsi-14
client: srgsi-15
